## Project Motivation <a name="motivation"></a>
Marketing an online programming course effectively requires thorough market research to identify the right audience—one with the highest likelihood of purchasing the course. Many believe that the only way to understand the market is through extensive manual research. However, in today's era of technological advancements, data-driven insights can provide a more efficient and accurate way to determine the ideal target audience.

To achieve this, I utilized Stack Overflow’s 2017 Developer Survey, which consists of over 60,000 responses from developers across more than 200 countries. This dataset includes valuable insights into developers’ interests and specializations, enabling a more strategic approach to marketing an online course.

I focused on answering three key questions to refine the marketing strategy:
1. Who should be targeted by the campaign?
    By analyzing the most popular programming languages in different regions, I determined the best target audiences for specific courses.
2. Does the employment type of the customer segment play a role in their interest?
    Understanding the employment status of developers provided insights into their purchasing power and willingness to invest in professional development.
3. What database frameworks do Python developers prefer?
    Identifying the most commonly used databases among Python developers allowed for more tailored course content, ensuring greater relevance to learners.

## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>
All of the analysis in the project was done in the Course_Marketing.ipynb file. Additionally, I included an image in the analysis file for visuals (lang.jpg).
